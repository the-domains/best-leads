# About us

Who We Are

Phillip Lyle

With twelve years experience working at trade shows -- gathering leads and surveying attendees -- Phillip has developed formulas to produce a successful event for those wanting to better connect to attendees.

"Over the years with the use of new technology I have been able to significantly reduce our costs and increase our results".

Michael Baker

Michael has a diverse background in roles where understanding human

behaviour and communication is critical to influencing people: tertiary education, defence, politics, and sales in the private sector. Success at trade shows with these tools has developed experience and insight into how to make trade show engagement more financially successful and more enjoyable."
